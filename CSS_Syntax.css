 CSS Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the appearance of web pages. The
basic syntax of CSS consists of a selector and one or more declarations enclosed
in curly braces. Each declaration includes a property and a value, separated by a
colon. 

selector {
    property: value
}

-> Selector: Selects the HTML element(s) to which the style should be applied.
Selectors can target elements by tag name, class, ID, or other attributes.

Example: h1 targets all <h1> elements, .my-class targets elements with the
class "my-class", #my-id targets the element with the ID "my-id".

-> Property: Specifies the aspect of the element to style, such as color , 
fontsize , background-color , etc.

-> Value: Defines the value for the property, such as red , 20px , #fff , etc.

-> Declaration Block: Contains one or more declarations enclosed in curly
braces {} . Multiple declarations are separated by semicolons ; .


-->   CSS rules can be placed in an external CSS file and linked to an HTML
document using the <link> tag in the <head> section, or they can be included
directly in the <style> tag within the HTML document.


-->  CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements, and the cascading
nature of CSS allows for the application of multiple styles to the same element,
with specificity determining which style takes precedence.

Understanding the basic syntax of CSS is fundamental for styling web pages
effectively and is a foundational concept for further exploration of CSS.
