Selectors are a fundamental part of CSS that allow you to target specific elements
in an HTML document and apply styles to them. There are several types of
selectors, each serving a different purpose:

 1. Element Selector ( tagname ): Selects all elements of a specific tag name.

 p {
    color: blue;
 }
 This example selects all <p> elements and sets their text color to blue.


 2. Class Selector ( .classname ): Selects all elements with a specific class name.

 .highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
 }
 This example selects all elements with the class "highlight" and sets their
 background color to yellow.


 3.  ID Selector ( #idname ): Selects a single element with a specific ID.

 #header {
    font-size: 24px;
 }
 This example selects the element with the ID "header" and sets its font size to
24 pixels.


4. Attribute Selector ( [attribute=value] ): Selects elements with a specific attribute
and value.

input [type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
This example selects all <input> elements with the attribute type set to "text"
and sets a border style for them.


5. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Selects elements based on their state
or position in the document.
Pseudo-classes: :hover , :active , :focus , etc.
Pseudo-elements: ::before , ::after, etc.

a:hover {
    color: red;
   }

   li::before {
    content: "•";
    margin-right: 5px;
   }
   These examples style links ( <a> elements) to change color on hover and add a
bullet ( • ) before each list item ( <li> element).


6. Combination Selectors: Combines multiple selectors to target specific
elements more precisely.
- Descendant Selector ( ancestor descendant ): Selects an element that is a
descendant of another specified element.
- Child Selector ( parent > child ): Selects an element that is a direct child of
another specified element.
- Adjacent Sibling Selector ( prev + next ): Selects an element that is
immediately preceded by a specified element.
- General Sibling Selector ( prev ~ siblings ): Selects all elements that are
siblings of a specified element.

div p {
    color: green;
}

ul > li {
    font-weight: bold;
}

h2 + p {
    margin-top: 0;
}

p ~ span {
    font-style: italic;
}
These examples demonstrate various combination selectors targeting different
element relationships.

Understanding these selectors is crucial for precisely targeting elements in your
HTML document and applying styles effectively.
